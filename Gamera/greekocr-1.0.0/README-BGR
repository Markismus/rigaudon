This is a much-altered version of greekocr-1.0.0. It provides the following addtional features:
- a 'split' switch, which allows elements identifed as _splitx or _splity to be properly split
  as part of the classification process
- an 'autogroup' switch, which causes the classifier to try to group up to four discrete elements
  into recognized glyphs
- a 'profile' switch, which will dump profiling information on the stdout

To make the autogroup feature work properly, you need to alter line of 
/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/gamera/classify.py
it should read "return found_unions, removed", omitting the reference to splits. Splitting performed
at this stage will possibly perform splits on elements that subsequently will be identified as 
elements of a grouped glyph. The result, in our workflow, is increased erroneous additional glyphs,
especially accents.

It wold be more efficient to change the classify.py code more extensively, 
but for now this work-around is effective.

I like to build this locally, and avoid spamming the source tree with:
python setup.py build -b /tmp/pybuild/greekocr install --prefix=/home/broberts/python
